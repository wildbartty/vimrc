Create a new pfuture with process ARGS.
This will return a struct (as created by `cl-defstruct') with 2 fields:
'process' which is the process object that will be started and 'result', where
the process will be writing its output.

Note that ARGS must be a *list* of strings as demanded by `make-process'.
In other words
This is wrong: (pfuture-new \"git status\")
This is right: (pfuture-new \"git\" \"status\")
